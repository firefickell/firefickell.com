title: Rutgers 2024 - Pretty solid!
categories: games

Looks like we benefitted from some really bad offense by Rutgers, but both our
offense and defense did what they needed to do. Mostly a fun watch! Other than
the latter part of 2nd quarter it looked good.

94 points in 2 weeks!

Wisconsin: 42\
Rutgers: 7
