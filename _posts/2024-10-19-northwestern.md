title: Northwestern 2024
categories: games
---

This one relied on some great defensive plays. A forced fumble with Northwestern
on their own goal line leads to a quick 7 for Wisconsin. And later the defense
gave us a safety. The defense continues to be stingy giving up only 16 points in
the last 3 games.

Wisconsin: 24\
Northewestern: 3
