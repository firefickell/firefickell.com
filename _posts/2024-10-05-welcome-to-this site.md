Welcome to my site. This site is not (yet) calling for Coach Fickell to be
fired. I'm still optimistic for the team (maybe naively)

Rumor has it that a friend routinely would call for the firing by sending out
links to this site. I was surprised that the site didn't exist at the time. So I
thought it would be funny if the friend opened up the site and found not only
that it existed but that it contained his picture (which it did for a little while.)
